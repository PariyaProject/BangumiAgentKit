## OP-001 Voice Actor Workload

Status:
DELIVERED_IN_PR-7D_BOUNDED

User question:

“水濑祈最近半年是不是特别忙？”

User Value:
5/5

Agent Leverage:
5/5

Data Availability:
5/5

Possible Sources:
S1 + S7

Potential Capability:
analyze_voice_actor_workload

Potential Renderer:
VoiceActorWorkload

Notes:
The full 3/6/12 month comparison is deferred: official person relationship
payloads do not include air dates and the repository has no compatible snapshots.
PR-7D will first deliver evidence-bearing static person/media/role/credit counts;
time-window workload remains explicitly not-computable until its source contract
is bounded.

## OP-005 Subject Staff Intelligence

Status:
DELIVERED_IN_PR-7D

User question:

“少女终末旅行的导演、脚本、音乐和声优分别是谁？”

User Value:
5/5

Agent Leverage:
5/5

Data Availability:
5/5

Possible Sources:
S1 + S7

Potential Capability:
get_subject_staff

Potential Renderer:
Staff / PersonProfile

Notes:
Official `/v0/subjects/{id}/persons` returns person identity, raw relation,
episode/track participation, and image. Preserve raw relation labels while
grouping them deterministically; do not infer a broader role taxonomy in this cycle.

## OP-006 Calendar / Schedule Intelligence

Status:
SELECTED_FOR_PR-7E

User questions:

“今天和本周有哪些动画，什么时候播？”

“为什么今天的播出日历不完整？”

User Value:
5/5

Agent Leverage:
4/5

Data Availability:
5/5

Reliability:
4/5

Possible Sources:
Official legacy `/calendar` through the existing Provider seam

Potential Capability:
calendar_intelligence

Potential Renderer:
CalendarSchedule

Notes:
The existing calendar path is read-only and source-bounded but loses useful schedule
facts and coverage semantics at the semantic boundary. PR-7E will preserve air dates,
ratings, types, ranks, missing fields, caps, evidence, and unavailable states without
adding OAuth, personal watchlists, HTML, Structured Web, snapshots, or write authority.
